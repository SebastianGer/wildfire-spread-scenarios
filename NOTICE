This repository’s top‑level LICENSE file applies only to files that do not carry their own license headers or LICENSE files; third_party/* directories and files, as well as src/dataloader/CityscapesDataModule.py, retain their stated licenses. Below, we explicitly list these licenses and the main changes we made to the respective files.


Parts of the following third-party components are included under third-party/ in this repository:

Files in third_party/ProbabilisticUnetPytorch
Original repository: https://github.com/stefanknegt/Probabilistic-Unet-Pytorch
Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
Changes made:
- Made imports relative 
- Removed custom initialization
- Removed manual setting of device in most spots
- Removed .git and .gitignore


Files in third_party/edm
Original repository: https://github.com/NVlabs/edm
Copyright (c) 2022, NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. All rights reserved.
Licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License.
Changes made:
- Removed most files and parts of code that are not used in this project for clarity.
- Added versions of EDMPrecond and SongUNet that can take images as conditioning.
- Added a version of SongUNet that is reduced to be only an encoder.
- Added a version of EDMLoss with various small modifications.
- Added separate functions timestep_schedule, time_step_discretization, euler_step to make it easier to reuse parts of the code. 
  The functionality of these functions is essentially the same as in the original code. 
- euler_step allows for asymmetric time differences as used in Analog Bits, and noisy conditioning (CADS). 
- Modified versions of the edm sampler are contained in src/models/edm/generate_diverse.py. 
  They are not included in the third_party directory, since they contain large parts of code that were not part of the original EDM repository.
  The parts of the code that are from the EDM repository fall under the respective original copyright. 
  The modifications fall under this project's copyright notice. The whole file falls under the indicated creative commons license.


Files in third_party/MoSEAUSeg
Original repository: https://github.com/gaozhitong/MoSE-AUSeg
Licensed under the Apache License, Version  2.0.
Changes made: 
- Added makefolder method from original utils.py file to lidc_data_loader.py, since we did not need any of the other code. 
- Changed the way the data is loaded from pickle file.
- Added tqdm for progress tracking.


Furthermore, the following files are largely based on existing code. We felt that it made more sense, in terms of code organization, to not place these individual files in the third-party directory, but rather place them where they are used in our project.

File src/dataloader/CityscapesDataModule.py
Original code: https://github.com/Lightning-Universe/lightning-bolts/blob/2c4602aa684e7b90e7ffdcea1d3f93a20f9c2ead/src/pl_bolts/datamodules/cityscapes_datamodule.py
Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
Changes made:
- Removed unneeded warnings. Removed seed that doesn't seem to be used.
- Changed the default transformations for images.
- Changed the default transformations for targets, to deal with multi-modal targets.

File src/firespreadscenarios/preprocessing/generate_simfire/simfire_config_class.py
Original repository: https://github.com/mitrefireline/simfire/

Changes made: 
- LandFireLatLongBox: Fix the string representation of the bounding box. The original version encodes many space characters, due to line breaks in the string definition.
- Config: Manually set a certain area in the western USA from which locations are randomly sampled
